# sanctum-zero

Foundational primitives from an early core archive.

This repository contains structural components extracted from an earlier system build, including:

- File path scaffolding
- Agent behavior patterns
- Symbolic layer governance
- Local-first operational notes

It is not a framework.
It is not a product.
It is substrate.

See `CANON.md` for symbolic governance rules.

See docs/`operating_philosophy.md` for architectural principles.
