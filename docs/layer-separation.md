# Layer Separation Policy

Sanctum contains multiple creative and operational layers.

Fiction (narrative work, mythic expression, publishing projects)
and System Architecture (Sanctum, daemon, governance primitives)
are interwoven but not collapsed.

Symbolic resonance may cross layers.
Operational authority does not.

Cross-layer contamination without deliberate user intent
is considered drift.
