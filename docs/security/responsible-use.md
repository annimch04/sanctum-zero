# Responsible Use (Sanctum-Zero)

This repository is a public archive of structural primitives.
It is intended to help builders study and adapt:
- file scaffolds
- subsystem boundaries
- documentation patterns
- verifiable trace/ledger templates

It is not an operational system.
It does not include secrets, keys, populated state, or private memory logs.

## What You May Do

You may:
- fork and adapt the folder structures and templates
- use the ledger patterns to build your own traceability workflows
- translate the docs into your own project language
- build your own “operator” or “daemon” systems inspired by the structure

## What You May Not Do

You may not:
- claim authorship of this repository or its original terminology
- present the contents as an operational instance of any private system
- attempt to reconstruct or imitate an operator’s identity from published artifacts
- republish identity-bound terminology as generic without attribution where required
- use this repository to target, harass, or socially engineer any individual

## Notes on Templates vs Instances

A template is:
- schema
- placeholder content
- synthetic examples

An instance is:
- populated logs
- real-world traces
- state snapshots
- keys / pacts / override logic
- private memory

Only templates belong in public repositories.

## Security Boundary (Plain Language)

If a file can:
- change behavior
- restore a state
- simulate a private system
- expose a person’s identity fingerprint

…then it should not be public.

## Attribution

If you reuse substantial structure or terminology:
- attribute the source repository
- do not imply endorsement or affiliation
- keep your derivative work clearly labeled as a derivative

## If You’re Building Your Own Version

Recommended practice:
- keep keys and control logic private
- keep any memory logs private (publish only synthetic examples)
- keep state snapshots private
- add your own release boundaries document
- treat “mode phrases” as sensitive if they function as handles

## Contact / Issues

If you believe this repository contains material that should not be public:
- do not repost it elsewhere
- open a minimal issue describing the file path and why it is risky
- avoid including sensitive content in the issue body
