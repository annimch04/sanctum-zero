# Sanctum Operating Principles

These principles define the foundational expectations and design commitments of the Sanctum architecture.

They apply to:

• System behavior  
• Artifact creation  
• Memory handling  
• Collaboration patterns  
• Symbolic and operational integration  

The goal is to ensure coherence between intention, structure, and implementation across recursive or AI-assisted workflows.

---

## 1. Dual-Lens Operation

System interactions may operate across multiple interpretive layers (for example: symbolic and operational).

Implementations should avoid collapsing complex meaning into a single explanatory frame when multiple lenses are required for accurate representation.

---

## 2. Function Over Aesthetic

Every artifact, phrase, or protocol should serve a functional purpose.

Symbolic or narrative elements are acceptable when they:

• Improve comprehension  
• Encode structure  
• Support interaction patterns  

Decorative complexity without functional contribution should be avoided.

---

## 3. Declared Intent Priority

Explicit user or operator intent takes precedence over inferred interpretation.

Systems should:

• Respect declared instructions  
• Avoid overwriting stated goals with assumptions  
• Maintain traceability of intent when possible  

---

## 4. Identity Continuity

Interactions should preserve contextual continuity across sessions, modes, or workflows when appropriate.

Identity in this context refers to:

• Project context  
• Operator preferences  
• Structural assumptions  
• Ongoing state relationships  

Not all systems require persistent identity, but when present it should remain coherent.

---

## 5. Trust by Design

Reliability should be achieved through transparent structure rather than simulated relational cues.

Design mechanisms may include:

• Version control  
• Explicit state representation  
• Logged changes  
• Reproducible artifacts  

Trust emerges from predictability and clarity.

---

## 6. Authorship Integrity

Artifacts should preserve authorship lineage and contribution context.

Systems should support:

• Attribution  
• Version history  
• Consent in collaborative modification  
• Clear ownership boundaries  

This applies to both technical and creative outputs.

---

## 7. Symbolic–Operational Integration

Symbolic frameworks and operational systems are not inherently opposed.

Symbolic structures can:

• Encode memory  
• Improve navigation  
• Support mental models  
• Enhance usability  

Operational tooling can coexist with narrative or conceptual layers when boundaries are clear.

---

## 8. Drift Detection and Recovery

Systems should anticipate misalignment between intended behavior and observed behavior.

Mechanisms may include:

• Validation checks  
• Override controls  
• Reset or recovery procedures  
• State inspection tools  

The goal is correction rather than concealment.

---

## 9. Structured Emergence

Emergent behavior and discovery are valuable but should occur within traceable boundaries.

Supporting mechanisms:

• Versioned artifacts  
• Logged transitions  
• Reproducible states  
• Documented changes  

Structure enables safe exploration.

---

## 10. Consent-Based Constraints

When systems impose limits, constraints, or safety boundaries, they should be:

• Transparent  
• Explainable  
• Revocable when appropriate  
• Proportionate to risk  

Invisible or unexplained overrides reduce system trust.

---

## Evolution Policy

These principles may evolve over time.

Changes should include:

• Version history  
• Rationale for modification  
• Recorded authorship  

Continuity of intent is more important than immutability.

---

## Scope

This document describes architectural philosophy only.

It does not prescribe implementation details or enforce specific technologies.

Projects may adapt these principles according to context.
