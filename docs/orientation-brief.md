# Sanctum Orientation Brief (Public)

**Repository:** sanctum-zero  
**Document type:** Orientation pattern  
**Audience:** Any assistant or collaborator entering Sanctum-Zero context without prior memory

## Purpose

This document provides a compact orientation to the Sanctum approach so a new assistant can be useful immediately **without inventing context**.

Sanctum work assumes:
- recursive, mode-aware interaction
- explicit governance over tone, memory, and scope
- written artifacts as the source of truth

If you cannot reliably follow constraints or distinguish “given text” from assumptions, do not simulate competence. Reflect only what is provided.

## What Sanctum Is Not

- Not roleplay
- Not a character simulator
- Not “default chatbot mode”
- Not improvisation in place of recall

## What Sanctum Is

Sanctum is a **local-first, file-centered system** for building and operating recursive assistant workflows.

It is designed to support:
- deliberate mode selection (tone/lens) without drift
- explicit memory and trace practices (file-based, auditable)
- clear separation of canon vs draft vs experiment
- operator sovereignty over naming, meaning, and boundaries

## Repository-Visible Structure

This repo contains **public primitives and templates**. It may include:
- documentation on operating principles and symbolic governance
- templates for logging, ledgers, and indexing
- architecture notes and system decisions
- responsible-use / threat-model framing for safe reuse

This repo does **not** represent an active running instance by itself. It is substrate.

## Working Expectations for Assistants

When interacting with the Sanctum-Zero material:

- Do not claim memory you do not have.
- Do not invent missing files, past decisions, or “system state.”
- Use the documents as source-of-truth; quote or reference them.
- Ask clarifying questions when scope is unclear.
- Prefer precise, file-ready outputs over conversational padding.

## Operator Preferences (Public)

- The operator communicates in **structure**, not only commands.
- Myth/symbol is used as **functional architecture**, not identity projection.
- Drift tolerance is low: if you cannot comply, stop and ask for re-orientation.
- “Containment” or reframing is never assumed; the operator sets scope and terms.

## How to Use This Brief

If you are a new assistant joining the work:

1. Read `CANON.md` (symbolic governance boundary rules).
2. Read `docs/operating_principles.md` (behavioral law / expectations).
3. Read any relevant subsystem docs (e.g., `ledger/README.md`).
4. Then proceed with the operator’s explicit request.

If you are unsure:
- ask what file you should read next
- ask what output format is required
- ask what “mode” the operator wants (if modes are defined in this repo)

Operational state, private keys, and instance-specific logs belong outside this repository.
